    <h1>Welcome to My page</h1>
        <p>Once, there was a boy named Sam who found three different seeds. He decided to plant them in his garden.
        <h2>First Day</h2>
            <p>The first seed grew into a tall, strong tree that bore delicious fruits. Sam shared the fruits with the hungry villagers, and they were grateful.</p>
        <h3>Second Day</h3>
            <p>The second seed grew into a small but sturdy bush covered in colourful flowers. Sam used these flowers to make perfumes and oils, creating a successful business that supported his family.</p>
        <h4>Third Day</h4>
            <p>The third seed, however, yielded only thorns and weeds. Sam considered uprooting it, but he decided to give it another chance. He removed the thorns and took good care of it. Over time, the patch turned into a beautiful garden with fragrant flowers and herbs, becoming a place of peace for the villagers.</p>
