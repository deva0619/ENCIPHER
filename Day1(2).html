    </header>
    <section>
        <p>I am a Computer Science and Engineering student, and I want to learn HTML because it is the first step in creating websites. HTML is the basic language used to build web pages, and by learning it, I can start making my own websites.</p>

        <p>HTML is important because it helps me add structure and content to a webpage. I am excited to learn it because it will allow me to turn my ideas into real websites that anyone can see on the internet.</p>

        <p>Learning HTML will also help me understand other web skills, like CSS and JavaScript, which will allow me to make more interactive and creative websites in the future. Overall, I want to learn HTML because it is the starting point for creating something cool and sharing it with the world.</p>
